
# RD3 Novel Omics EMX
#
# The EMX structure for the novel omics subpackage is largely based on the
# main RD3 tables (e.g., Freeze1, Freeze2, etc.). This model may expand over
# time, but for now the labinfo table has been replaced by the `labinfo_wgs`.
#
# In the main emx structre, you must render the `rd3_freeze.yaml` file and
# merge with this file.
